We are True North.

We provide IT consulting, services and product development to our clients.
We are a young, technology-driven software & AI company, focused on cloud-native development
and deisgning modern distributed enterprise systems.

In True North we connect software engineering and data analysis, in order to prepare our clients for the
future and help them become and remain winners of their respective industries.
Also, we love Kubernetes whether in public cloud environments like AWS/GCP/IBMCloud/etc. or on premise,
and we are pretty great at DevOps side of the story. Open-source is embedded deeply in our DNA.
